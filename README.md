# ATM Simulator in C++

This is a mini console-based ATM project written in C++. It simulates basic ATM functionalities including:

- 🔐 User authentication (account number + PIN)
- 💰 Balance inquiry
- 💵 Cash withdrawal with balance check
- 📱 Update registered mobile number
- 👤 View user details

## 💡 Features
- Simple object-oriented design using a class `atm`
- Hardcoded user details for demonstration
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Infinite menu loop until user exits

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (like `g++`):
   ```bash
   g++ atm.cpp -o atm
   ./atm
